1. Purpose of this Git repository

This Git repo has been used as my workplace for the comp-20 course at Tufts University. There are assignments and projects that I have in it.

2. Favorite assignment

My favorite assignment was the Landmarks assignment. I became very familiar will the style of programming that web requires, and was able to observe a very tangible example of my work.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now? 

My understanding of the Web has grown exponentially. I had a good understanding of C++ but web is trully a different beast. I was very happy to work on many aspects of web development as opposed to just focusing on one topic. 

4. What was the most important thing you learned in this course?

The most important concept that was solidified for me was the way things are built independantly, but are linked together. In scope of the internet, computers, networks, and servers are all independent projects. However, we piece them all together to create a unified internet/web browsing experience. In the scope of our assignments in this class, we built the landmarks assignment completely independantly of the heroku/mongodb assignment. Then we pieced the two together to create a full project. Everything can be built upon. Even the most complicated systems can be used as building blocks or foundations.

5. What would you like to delve deeper into

I would like to explore more mobile development with things like iOS and Android development. Recreate the landmarks assignment in Xcode?
