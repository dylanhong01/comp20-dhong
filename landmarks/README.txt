1.Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not

To my knowledge, everything works correctly.

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

Discussed with Ryan Biette, Julia Rosenberg, and Garrett Dickson.
I used Ming's examples as a template for the XML and Google maps api integration. I also used the included stackoverflow link to calculate the distance with the Haversone formula: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript. I also used https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polyline-simple for their example of how to use the polyline feature.

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

Approx 7 hours
